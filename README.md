# Monorepo React CRA/yarn workspaces/lerna

In this repository I tried to setup a monorepo to use React CRA with shared
components and a storybook.

# Why CRA

Using `Create React App` is the best way to follow react update and keep
compatibility with new features.

In this repo I tried to touch CRA config as little as possible.

# Goals

- [X] React create app that use shared components
  - [X] Hot reloading
- [ ] Storybook
  - [ ] Using view from React CRA app
  - [ ] Using component from shared library
