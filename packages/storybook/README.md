# Storybook

This project has been init with storybook CLI and `@storybook/create-react-app-preset`,
then the webpack configuration has been updated.

We use `babel-loader` to transpile file from others repositories before build too.

All is done in [`.storybook/main.js`](.storybook/main.js).

## Getting started

You can run storybook:

```
$ yarn run start
```

You can build storybook:

```
$ yarn run build
```
